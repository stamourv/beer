# Mars, the Bringer of Wort (Irish Red)

Based on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/176vle/red_ale_input/)
and [this](http://beerrecipes.org/showrecipe.php?recipeid=6768).

## Ingredients

* 3 lbs Golden Promise
* 3 lbs Red X
* 1/6 lb CaraMunich 60
* 1/2 oz Fuggles
* Safale English Ale yeast

## Brewing

* Mash temp: 150-154F
* 3/8 oz Fuggles @ 60
* 1/8 oz Fuggles @ 15

## Notes

Turned out a bit bland. Red X as base did well on the color front, but
not really on the taste front. That, and dry yeast underperforming
resulted in a disappointing beer.

### Unknown date, pre-mid-2015
* Yielded 9-9.5 qts, had to dump some to fit in (2 gal) fermenter.
* OG 1.055 (80% mash efficiency!) (in style)
* FG 1.026 (this is too high for style)
* 3.8% ABV
* Dry yeast didn't seem to do a great job.
