# CursESB (ESB)

Based on [this recipe](http://www.fermentarium.com/homebrewing/brewing-beer/how-to-make-an-esb-extra-specialstrong-bitter/).

## Ingredients

* 0.25 pounds 20 Crystal malt
* 0.25 pounds 40 Crystal malt
* 2 oz Fuggle (5.0% AA)
* Wyeast 1968 London ESB

## Brewing

* Mash temp: 152F
* 4/3 oz Fuggle @ 60
* 2/3 oz Fuggle @ 5

## Notes

I love ESBs, but this one didn't really work. Could be the recipe, could
be our fault.

### Aug 15 2015
* Used 2.25 gallons mash water.
* Didn't calculate strike temp properly (or at all?) so adding grain
  brought us down to 140. Kept heating, but overshot, then cooled down,
  and ended up at 150 by the end of the mash.
* Boiled off a bit too much (ended a bit short of 2 gallons), so
  backfilled with tap water.
* OG 1.054
* FG 1.021
* ABV 4.33%
* Tasted pretty bitter at first, but mellowed after some time.
* Named it EECSB, gave as bribe^Wgift for office space.

### Early Jan 2016
* Replaced crystal 40 with crystal 60 (store was out of 40).
* Used 3 gallons mash water. Got better efficiency.
* Kitchen fire (trivet on stove). Hence the curse.
* OG 1.056ish (forgot the exact number, and didn't write down)
* FG 1.013
* ABV 5.64%
* Marcel's was left in the sun in his office, next to a computer, and
  exploded. Hence the curse.
