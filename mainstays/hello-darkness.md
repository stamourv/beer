# Hello Darkness (Porter)

Based on [this recipe](http://www.homebrewingblog.com/all-grain-vanilla-porter/),
but dropped vanilla after first batch.

## Ingredients

* 4lb pale malt
* 1.5 lb crystal 120
* 0.5 lb chocolate malt
* 0.25 lb black patent malt
* 0.25 lb flaked barley
* 1 oz east kent goldings
* omega yeast oyl-004 (west coast ale I) (same strain as wyeast 1056, american ale)

## Brewing

* Mash temp: 156
* 0.5 oz EKG @ 50
* 0.5 oz EKG + irish moss @ 10

## Notes

A solid performer. Nothing outstanding, but worth doing again.

### Dec 6 2015
* 2.25 gallons mash water.
* After 1.5 week, added some homemade vanilla extract (which was kind of wimpy).
* Added some more when bottling, but still not too strong a taste.
* OG 1.041
* FG 1.023
* ABV 2.x%, so a bit low

### Feb 13 2016
* OG 1.044
* FG 1.023
* ABV 2.76%

### Nov 19 2016
* OG 1.043
* FG 1.021 (after priming sugar, though)
* ABV 2.89%
* A bit flat, but good.
