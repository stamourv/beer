# Dezemberzen (MÃ¤rzen)

## Ingredients

* 6 lb Munich malt
* 0.5 oz Hallertau
* Wyeast 2308 munich lager

## Brewing

* Didn't record mash temp, so probably 152F
* 3/8 oz Hallertau @ 60
* 1/8 oz Hallertau @ 20

## Notes

Definitely a winner. Takes a while with lagering, but worth the wait.
Probably wouldn't attempt without decent temperature control, though.

### Dec 2014
* Primary and secondary in jrslepak's uninsulated cabinet.
* Lagering partly in the cabinet, partly in the fridge.

### Sep 3 2016
* Went with 3/4 oz Tradition, which I had left over from something else.
* OG 1.043
* FG 1.020 (after adding priming sugar)
* ABV 3.02%
* Used our new lagerator for that (old kegerator, with thermostat added).
* Lagering schedule was weird because of travel. Started diacetyl rest
  (raised temp to 62F) on the 27th. Then bottled on Oct 2. Then lowered
  temp 4F/day until 35F. Lagered for 6+ weeks.
