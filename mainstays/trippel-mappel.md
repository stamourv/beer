# Trippel Mappel (Trippel)

Based on [this recipe](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f71/belgian-tripel-72110/)
but with maple syrup instead of candi sugar.

## Ingredients

* 6lb pilsen malt (could also use Special B)
* 1oz hallertau / tettnang @ 60
* 12oz maple syrup, the good stuff
* Wyeast 3787 trappist high gravity

## Brewing

* Mash temp: 150
* All hops @ 60
* Add maple syrup when wort is chilling

## Notes

One of our best. Each batch ends up different, but always great.

### Unknown date, pre-mid-2015
* For reasons lost to time, we ended up mashing: 4.355lb maris otter,
  0.240lb crystal 30, 0.120lb special roast. Don't ask me why.
* Also for reasons long since forgotten (not enough mash water? too
  strong/long boil?), we had a yield of maybe 1 gallon, or not much more.
  OG must have been pretty high (that was pre-hydrometer-purchase), but
  the end result was *fantastic*. Best we'd ever brewed, and possibly
  still unsurpassed.

### Unknown date, pre-mid-2015
* 7.5qt mash water (1.25 qt/lb).
* Did a ladle-sparge for that one. Never did it again, so probably
  wasn't worth the trouble.
* Gravity before boil: 1.053, so mash efficiency of ~47%
* Used dry yeast (Safbrew abbaye). I forget how this one went, but dry
  yeast hasn't turned out great for us in general.
* 7qt yield (6qt post-boil, 1qt extra bag drippings)
* OG 1.077
* FG 1.029
* Used maple syrup as priming sugar (1/2 oz per 12oz bottle)

### Dec 20 2015
* Used tettnang (store was out of hallertau)
* OG 1.051 -- way low. bad efficiency? we measured after putting the yeast, though...
* FG 1.010-12
* ABV 5.12-5.38%

### Jun 18 2016
* OG 1.063
* FG 1.004
* ABV 6.43%

### Mar 10 2018
* Used 24 oz of maple syrup
* We did screw up the sparge some, by squeezing the bag into sparge water
  before sparging, so the sparge water started already sweet...
* OG 1.062 -- a bit low, especially considering amount of syrup, but see above
  was lower at first, then stirred the wort (to mix maple syrup), then got
  higher so may actually be higher still. Volume was high, too, 3+ gal...
  Was fiercely bubbling the day after, though.
* Mar 11th, airlock was bubbling a lot. Then overnight, overflowed. On 12th,
  lots of greenish paste (thick, solid) to clean up. Probably just yeast...
  But that's one that we may want to do in smaller volumes.
* FG 1.013 (after priming sugar, though)
* ABV 6.43%
* Apr 30th, 2 weeks after bottling, 2 bottles burst overnight. Shattered.
  Put in big plastic bins, to contain further explosions.
  Then 3 days later, another bottle burst.
  At some point, 2 more bottles burst. In the other bin.
  Deemed the batch was not worth saving. Taped the bins shut, then threw
  the whole bins away. RIP
* Never got to actually try it.
