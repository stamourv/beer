## Notes

One of my go-tos. Solid recipe with a good track record.

### Spring 2015
* Yielded 7 quarts.
* OG 1.058
* FG 1.021
* ABV 4.86%
* Turned out delicious! One of the best we've made.

### Aug 29th 2015
* used St. Celeia
* OG 1.058
* FG 1.017
* ABB 5.38%
* A bit sweet? Good, but not as good as my memory of the first batch.

### Feb 28th 2016
* Did just one rest, at 148.
* Used 1/4 oz tradition, divided that 1/3 @ 60, 20, 10.
* OG 1.052 (!)
* FG 1.025 (but that was with priming sugar added in)
* ABV 3.54%

### Apr 8th 2017
* Screwed up mash.
    * Put grain in right away (distracted).
    * Brought it up to 100, then rested 20 mins.
    * Then tried to bring it to 142. Thermometer read ~125, but mash looked like
      it was boiling. On testing, thermometer seemed to work...
    * Mashed for 1hr at whatever temperature that was.
* Had EKG in the freezer, so used that.
* Forgot to start the yeast when we started. Wow. We're not on top on things.
* OG 1.032
* FG 1.005 (before priming sugar)
* ABV 3.54%
