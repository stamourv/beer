A nice, refreshing IPA. Not a hop bomb at all. As expected, very much
like Founders' All Day IPA. Definitely a keeper.

### May 5 2018
* Fresh from burst bottles, so was very careful.
  Tried not using wort chiller, just in case (may get dirty).
* Forgot the flameout hop addition until maybe 1hr later, when wort
  was mostly chilled. Oops. Stayed there ~30mins, then strained as I
  put in fermenter.
* Dry hopped on May 19th.
* OG 1.035
* FG 1.008 (before priming sugar)
* ABV 3.54%
