# Beer Recipes

This repo contains beer recipes I have brewed over the years, with a
rotating cast of helpers.

Some of those I got from the web, or from someone else, and some we
created from whole cloth. I tried to add proper attribution wherever
possible.

Thanks to @jrslepak, @dotpyfe, and @khale for their help brewing,
finding, creating, and refining these recipes.
