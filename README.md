# Beer Recipes

This repo contains beer recipes I have brewed over the years, with a
rotating cast of helpers.

Some of those I got from the web, or from someone else, and some we
created from whole cloth. I tried to add proper attribution wherever
possible.

Thanks to @jrslepak, @dotpyfe, and @khale for their help brewing,
finding, creating, and refining these recipes.

## General Info

All recipes were brewed all-grain, brew-in-a-bag.

Recipes either yield 2 gallons (pre-mid-2015) or 3ish (mid-2015 on).
A few recipes may have lower yields due to higher gravity, or to
mistakes on our part at some point in the process.

## Historical Notes (of limited interest to anyone but me)

This does not include early extract / partial mash batches from
2011-2013ish; I have no plans to go back to extract brewing.
