# Beer Recipes

This repo contains beer recipes I have brewed over the years, with a
rotating cast of helpers.

Some of those I got from the web, or from someone else, and some we
created from whole cloth. I tried to add proper attribution wherever
possible.

Thanks to @jrslepak, @dotpyfe, and @khale for their help brewing,
finding, creating, and refining these recipes.

## General Info

All recipes were brewed all-grain, brew-in-a-bag.

Recipes either yield 2 gallons (pre-mid-2015) or 3ish (mid-2015 on).
A few recipes may have lower yields due to higher gravity, or to
mistakes on our part at some point in the process.
Most of the recipes were obtained by taking a 5-gallon recipe and
halving everything.

Our usual SOP is:
* 3 gallons of mash water, with some gypsum to compensate for Chicago's
  hard water (warning: cargo cult)
* 1 gallon of sparge water, dip sparge at 170-180F for 15 mins
* a pinch of irish moss at 10 before flameout
* 1/3 cup priming sugar dissolved in hot water, mixed in fermenter, for
  bottling

It took us some time to converge on that, though, so some earlier
batches may have been brewed differently.

## Historical Notes (of limited interest to anyone but me)

This does not include early extract / partial mash batches from
2011-2013ish; I have no plans to go back to extract brewing.
