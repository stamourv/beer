## Notes

### Jul 13 2017
* overshot 2nd mash temp, ended up at maybe 180, but settle back down towards 150
* also overshot sparge temp, which was basically boiling
* ended up doing a plain old 60 minute boil, for lack of time
* OG 1.047
* FG 1.017 (with priming sugar, though)
* ABV 3.94%
* forgot to do diacetyl rest before bottling, oops
* starting lagering at 62F anyway, then drop 4F per day until 35F
* Trying it: flavor was good, carbonation was uneven, and body was watery.
  Refreshing.
