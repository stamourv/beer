# Ordinary Bitter

Based on [this recipe](http://beerrecipes.org/showrecipe.php?recipeid=11642),
and scaled from 10 gallons to 2.

## Ingredients

* 3 lbs   pale malt (2 row) UK (3.0 SRM)
* .2 lbs  Carastan (British crystal 30)
* .1 lbs  Special Roast (50)
* 1 oz    East Kent Goldings hops
* 1 pkg   English Ale yeast (White Labs WLP002)

## Brewing

* 0.6 oz EKG @ 60
* 0.4 oz EKG @ 0

## Notes

Don't remember much about this one. If we do it again, probably want to
re-scale the recipe for 3 gallons  (divide by 3, instead of 5).

### Early 2015
* No particular notes.
