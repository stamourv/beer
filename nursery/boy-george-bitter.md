## Ingredients

* 3.5 lb maris otter
* 4oz crystal 120
* 2oz special roast malt 50L
* 1 oz east kent goldings
* Wyeast 1968 London ESB (didn't write down, but probably what we used)

## Brewing

* Mash temp: 152F
* 1/2 oz east kent goldings @ 60
* 1/4 oz east kent goldings @ 30
* irish moss @ 15
* 1/4 oz east kent goldings @ 1

## Notes

The one time we tried it (see below), it didn't work out, thought no
fault of the recipe. Probably worth trying again, if only to see whether
the recipe itself is any good.

### Jul 10 2016
* OG 1.033
* FG 1.014
* ABV 2.49%
* Fermenter was starting a gusher bug infection (we think), so this
  batch never really had a chance. Drank some and dumped some.
  Drinkable, but not very good, but also not representative of the
  recipe.
