# John McLambic (Lambic-like)

Mostly based on [this article](http://learn.kegerator.com/brewing-sour-beer/).
Not a real wild ale, but still a sour, with a lambic bug mix.

## Ingredients

* 6 lbs Pilsner Malt
* 5 lbs Wheat Malt
* 0.5 oz Fuggle (didn't have aged hops)
* generic american ale yeast (forget which we used, probably doesn't
  really matter)
* Wyeast 3278 Lambic Blend (for secondary)
* 24oz (thawed) frozen raspberries (for secondary)

## Brewing

* Mash temp: 152F
* All hops @ 90
* Do primary with regular ale yeast for 2 weeks
* After 2 weeks, add raspberries and lambic bugs
* Age for 6+ months, then bottle

## Notes

In progress.

### Dec 3 2016
* Used old (separate, most importantly) fermenter, to avoid
  cross-contamination.
* OG: 1.042
* Planning to bottle Jun-ish 2017.
