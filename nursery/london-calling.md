# London Calling (Bitter)

Based on [this recipe](http://byo.com/bock/item/2318-fuller%E2%80%99s-the-pride-of-london)
(which also has a recipe for Fuller's ESB).

## Ingredients

* 5lb 6oz pale malt (recipe calls for Muntons)
* 8oz crystal 75 (or closest)
* 1/3oz Target OR 1/3oz Nugget OR 1oz Fuggle (~3.5 AAU) @ 60
* 1/5oz Challenger OR 1/8oz Admiral OR 1/5oz Perle @ 15
* 1/5oz Northdown OR 1/8oz Admiral OR 1/5oz Challenger @ 15
* Wyeast 1968 London ESB

## Brewing

* Mash at 149F.

## Notes

### Aug 6th 2017
* Did crystal 80, 1 oz fuggle @ 60 and 1/2 oz challenger @ 15.
* Thermometer trouble, so may not have had high enough mash temperature.
* OG 1.041
* FG 1.010 (before priming sugar)
* ABV 4.07
* Trying it: off-flavor, maybe overcarbonated (did have high FG). Overly
  bitter. Not a success. We still can't do bitters.
* By Dec 2nd was really overcarbonated and tasted bitter and metallic.
  Definitely not good. Could be mild gusher bug infection. Subsequent
  batches were fine though.
  Ended up dumping what was left; bangs and sprays. Definitely infected.
