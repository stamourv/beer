# Saison in the Abyss (Saison)

Based on [this recipe](http://growlermag.com/homebrew-recipe-saison-classic/),
with a few changes.

## Ingredients

* 2.5 lb pilsner
* 2 lb vienna
* 10 oz red wheat malt
* 1 oz fuggle
* Wyeast 3711 french saison

## Brewing

* 1/2 oz fuggle at 60
* 1/2 oz fuggle at 15

## Notes

Turned out quite good. Not sure whether there's anything in particular
we'd want to change. Certainly worth doing again, and possibly promoting
to mainstays.

### Apr 30 2016
* OG 1.045
* FG 1.0
* AVB 5.91%
* Original recipe called for EKG or styrian goldings, but store was all
  out of both (and more). Worked fine with fuggle. Hops aren't the point
  here anyway.

### May 21 2017
* Store didn't have the 3711, so used 3724 belgian saison
* OG 1.038
* FG TODO
* ABV TODO
