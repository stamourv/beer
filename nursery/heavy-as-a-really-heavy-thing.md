# Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing (Wee Heavy)

Based on a recipe @khale found. Don't have the link, though.

## Ingredients

* 6lb Maris Otter
* 6oz Crystal 60L
* 4oz Victory Malt
* 2oz Aromatic Malt
* 1oz Black Patent Malt
* 1oz Roasted Barley
* 0.5oz East Kent Goldings
* 0.5oz Fuggles
* Wyeast 1728 Scottish Ale

## Brewing

* Mash temp: 156F
* Mash as usual, then boil off some of the liquid. Take gravity readings
  periodically, until gravity reaches ~1.070 or so. Then start actual boil.
* 3/8 oz EKG @ 60
* 3/8 oz Fuggles @ 60
* 1/8 oz EKG @ 60
* 1/8 oz Fuggles @ 60

### Notes

In progress.

### Dec 17 2016
* Don't do what I did, and put the hydrometer in too-hot liquid. That
  broke its thermometer. Let it cool down in the tube before putting
  it in.
* OG 1.113 (!) boiled down 3 gal mash + 1 gal sparge to 1+Îµ final.
  May have waiting too long before starting the actualy boil (maybe
  boiled off too much). Or maybe should have backfilled with water.
* Will the yeast be able to work through that? May want to give it 3-4
  weeks...
