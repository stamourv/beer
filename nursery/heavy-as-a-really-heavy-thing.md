# Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing (Wee Heavy)

Based on a recipe @khale found. Don't have the link, though.

## Ingredients

* 6lb Maris Otter
* 6oz Crystal 60L
* 4oz Victory Malt
* 2oz Aromatic Malt
* 1oz Black Patent Malt
* 1oz Roasted Barley
* 0.5oz East Kent Goldings
* 0.5oz Fuggles
* Wyeast 1728 Scottish Ale

## Brewing

* Mash temp: 156F
* Mash as usual, then boil off some of the liquid. Take gravity readings
  periodically, until gravity reaches ~1.070 or so. Then start actual boil.
* 3/8 oz EKG @ 60
* 3/8 oz Fuggles @ 60
* 1/8 oz EKG @ 60
* 1/8 oz Fuggles @ 60

### Notes

In progress.

### Dec 17 2016
* Don't do what I did, and put the hydrometer in too-hot liquid. That
  broke its thermometer. Let it cool down in the tube before putting
  it in.
* OG 1.113 (!) boiled down 3 gal mash + 1 gal sparge to 1+Îµ final.
  May have waiting too long before starting the actualy boil (maybe
  boiled off too much). Or maybe should have backfilled with water.
* Will the yeast be able to work through that? May want to give it 3-4
  weeks...
* Pierre-Michel explained the "reduction" bit of the original recipe.
  The point is to set aside 1gal, and boil *that* off. That would
  increase the gravity beyond the target (for that 1gal), and raise the
  boiling point (increased sugar concentration), which would allow the
  liquid to reach higher than 212F, and caramelize the sugar, which has
  an effect on taste. Merging that 1gal back in also raises gravity.
* FG 1.055 (!)
* ABV 8.86%
* Bottled after 4 weeks. Still had a bit of kreuzen on top, so hopefully
  yeast will be able to carbonate a bit. Too high FG could be a worry
  for overpressurization, though...
  added ~1/6 cup priming sugar anyway
* yield: 13 bottles
* This beer is a beast. Strong, heavy, syrupy. A bit overwhelming, even.
  So, just what we were shooting for.
* After 2 weeks, yeast did manage to carbonate a bit, but not much.
  Probably ok for the style.
