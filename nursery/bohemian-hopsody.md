# Bohemian Hopsody

## Ingredients

* 6 lbs pilsen malt -- was hoping for bohemian, belgian is all the store had
* 6 oz carapils / dextrine
* 2 oz Saaz
* Mangrove Jack's Bohemian Lager M84 (1 pack) -- that's all the store had
  was hoping for Wyeast 2001-PC Pilsner Urquell H-Strain OR Wyeast 2278 Czech Pils (2 packs)

* 4 gal distilled water (3 mash, 1 sparge) -- want soft water. Chicago's isn't.
  even authors who usually leave water alone make an exception for pilsners
* 3 tsp gypsum -- but not *that* soft

## Brewing

* mash at 149-152F (strike 158F)
  could do more interesting rest schedule. see second link (the one that talks about water)
* 0.4 oz Saaz @ 60
* 0.8 oz Saaz @ 30
* 0.4 oz Saaz @ 10
* Irish moss @ 10
* 0.4 oz Saaz @ 0
